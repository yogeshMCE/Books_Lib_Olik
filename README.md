- Create and retrieve book rentals
- Endpoints to retrieve books by author, available books for rent, and books currently rented
- Business logic for renting, returning, and checking for overdue rentals
- Error handling and validation for input data
- Unit and integration tests to verify functionality

## Tech Stack
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- JUnit and Mockito for unit testing
- Maven for dependency management

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Configure the application properties (e.g., database connection details).
4. Run the application.

## Usage
- Use a REST client (e.g., Postman) to test the endpoints.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Unit tests are located in the `src/test/java` directory and use JUnit and Mockito for testing individual components and methods.
- **Integration Tests**: Integration tests are located in the `src/test/java`.
